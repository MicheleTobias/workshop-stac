## Introduction

What are we generally trying to learn?

Why does it matter? Why do it this way vs. downloading images and storing them yourself?



## SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)

What is it? Why is it useful?

Define: 

* Collection
* Item
* Catalog
* STAC API


### Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)

What is a GeoTIFF? Why do you want to work with this?

What does "Cloud Optimized" mean? Why is this helpful?

This is helpful: [Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/) - probably because one of the authors looks very familiar!


### More detail about APIs in general and STAC API specifically


## A Typical Workflow:

1. First time only: Configure your environment & do your set up for authentication - i.e. sign up for an account and create the NetRC file

1. Authenticate (log in to your account using R or Python code)

1. Search the STAC catalog (using the API) to see what's available

1. Decide which images you want

1. Retrieve the data you want to work with

1. Run your analysis
